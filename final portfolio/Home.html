  <h2>WELCOME TO THE WORK AND WORLD OF GEORGE PALMER</h2>
 
  <p>Hello, my name is George Palmer and I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my website. I am currently a student at Illinois State University and am enrolled in the History Education program. I was previously enrolled in the Creative Technologies Program (CTK) as a sound design major, but I have decided to switch paths.</P>
<p>I love to make creative work, especially music. This website is meant to showcase the projects that I have created not only during my time at a CTK student, but also work that I create on my own time. </p>
