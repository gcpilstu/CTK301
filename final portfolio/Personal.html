            <p>If I had to pick one thing that I've made to show off it would be this track. This is easily my favorite song that I have ever made and I am really proud of it. I had just seen the first Dune movie when I sat down to make this track, I was really inspired by the huge sets and scale that movie gives off. I wanted to created a song that sounded like a foreign planet's battle march, alien warfare, and I am so happy with how it turned out.</P>

              <source src="garys space dance-[AudioTrimmer.com].wav" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
          <p>This is another of my favorite tracks that I have made. It's a more upbeat, house/dance kind of track, which now is what I typically enjoy making. When I first got into making music I was mainly focused on making rap beats, but after a couple of months I realized that what I really enjoyed making was dance music. This is one of my later projects and I am very happy with how it sounds.</P>

              <source src="beat for jackcut.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
          <p>This was one of the first beats I made, and while I don't hate it, I can definitely hear the flaws and the early beginnings of me making music. A lot of the sounds in this beat are sampled, as I didn't (and still don't) know how to play any intruments or really any formal music knowledge at all. Most of what I have learned has been through YouTube videos and other online sources. </P>
